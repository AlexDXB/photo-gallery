# photo-gallery
 
Project Overview

In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. At the top of the page there is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. There are  "back" and "previous" arrows to cycle through photos.
